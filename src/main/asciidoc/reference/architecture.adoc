While SDN 4 has been built from the ground up it is important to understand a little about it's architecture as it has significantly
diverged from SDN 3 and could have implications in how you design your application.


== Overview

SDN 3.x was monolithic in a sense that all mapping code, database drivers and Spring integrations were all in one.  SDN 4 has decided to
break these components up into:

* Drivers: At the moment these come in 3 variants: Embedded, HTTP and the binary protocol Bolt.
* The Object Graph Mapper (OGM): This is similar to an ORM in that it maps database nodes to java objects. This library is agnostic of any framework (including Spring).
* Spring Data Neo4j 4: Provides syntactic sugar and code on top of the OGM to help quickly build Spring Based Neo4j OGM apps.

Those coming from other Spring Data projects or are familiar with ORM products like JPA or Hibernate may quickly recognise this architecture.
A bulk of the heavy lifting has been moved into the OGM. The OGM's key interfaces that you will deal with regularly are the `Session` and
`SessionFactory`. It is worth understanding a little more about them.

The following diagram outlines how the components defined above:

[IMPORTANT]
It is expected users are familiar with the concepts in the OGM. To find out more check out the http://neo4j.com/docs/ogm-manual/current/[OGM library documentation].

=== SessionFactory

The `SessionFactory` is needed by SDN to create instances of `org.neo4j.ogm.session.Session` as required.
When constructed, it sets up the object-graph mapping metadata, which is then used across all `Session` objects that it creates.
As seen in the above example, the packages to scan for domain object metadata should be provided to the `SessionFactory` constructor.

Note that the session factory should typically be application-scoped.
While you can use a narrower scope for this if you like, there is typically no advantage in doing so.

[[reference.architecture.session]]
=== Session

A `Session` is used to drive the object-graph mapping framework. All repository implementations are driven by the `Session`.
It keeps track of the changes that have been made to entities and their relationships.
The reason it does this is so that only entities and relationships that have changed get persisted on save, which is particularly efficient when working with large graphs.


Sessions are usually bound to a thread by default and rely on the garbage collector to clean it up once it is out of scope of processing.
For most users this means there is nothing to configure.
Request/response type applications SDN will take care of Session management for you (as defined in the Configuration section above).
If you have a batch or long running desktop type application you may want to know how you can control using the session a bit more.

==== Design Consideration: Session caching

Once an entity is tracked by the session, reloading this entity within the scope of the same session will result in the session cache
returning the previously loaded entity. However, the subgraph in the session will expand if the entity or its related
entities retrieve additional relationships from the graph.

If you want to fetch fresh data from the graph, then this can be achieved by using a new session or clearing the current
sessions context using `org.neo4j.ogm.session.Session.clear()`.

The lifetime of the `Session` can be managed in code. For example, associated with single _fetch-update-save_ cycle or unit of work.

If your application relies on long-running sessions then you may not see changes made from other users and find yourself working with outdated objects.
On the other hand, if your sessions have too narrow a scope then your save operations can be unnecessarily expensive, as updates will be made to all objects if the session isn't aware of the those that were originally loaded.

There's therefore a trade off between the two approaches.
In general, the scope of a `Session` should correspond to a "unit of work" in your application.
