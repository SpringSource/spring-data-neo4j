=== Auditing

Spring Data Neo4j integrates into the Spring Data auditing infrastructure
to keep track of who created or changed an entity and the point in time this happened.

While Spring Data Neo4j uses the same annotations for auditing as all Spring Data modules do, auditing support itself has to be explicitly enabled.
To enable Spring Data Neo4j's auditing, use `@EnableNeo4jAuditing` on a `@Configuration`-class as shown in <<EnabledAuditing>>.

[source,java]
[[EnabledAuditing]]
.Neo4jConfiguration.java
----
import org.springframework.data.neo4j.annotation.EnableNeo4jAuditing;

@Configuration
@EnableNeo4jAuditing
public class Neo4jConfiguration {}

Please refer to the <<auditing,auditing>> section of the shared Spring Data reference for further details.
