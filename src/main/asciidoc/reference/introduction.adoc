It is important to understand how a Spring Data Neo4j (SDN) application is structured because this could have implications in how you design your application.

[[reference.architecture]]
== SDN Architecture

A high level look of the architecture looks like:

* *Drivers* are used to connect to the database.
At the moment these come in three variants:
_Embedded_, _HTTP_ and the binary protocol _Bolt_.
The latter uses the official Neo4j Java driver.

* *Neo4j Object Graph Mapper* (Neo4j-OGM)

* *Spring Data Neo4j* provides code on top of Neo4-OGM to help quickly build Spring based Neo4j apps.

Those coming from other Spring Data projects or are familiar with ORM products like JPA or Hibernate may quickly recognise this architecture.

[NOTE]
Please read the <<migration,Migration Guide>> for a smooth upgrade from Spring Data Neo4j 3.

== How to use this reference


Spring Data Neo4j is largely broken up into two main components:

- <<reference.ogm-support, Neo4j-OGM Support>>: Provides close integration between Spring Data and Neo4j-OGM, the main underlying technology used in SDN.
- <<neo4j.repositories, Spring Data Repository Support>>: Provides Spring Repository support.

It is recommended SDN developers also familiarise themselves with Neo4j-OGM. The Neo4j-OGM reference documentation has been reproduced after this
section for convenience.
