= Introduction

In order to understand what Spring Data Neo4j can do it is important to understand
how an SDN application is structured and this could have implications in how you design your application.

[[reference.architecture]]
== SDN Architecture

A high level look of the architecture looks like:

* *Drivers* are used to connect to the database.
At the moment these come in three variants:
_Embedded_, _HTTP_ and the binary protocol _Bolt_.
The latter uses the official Neo4j Java driver.

* *Neo4j Object Graph Mapper* (Neo4j-OGM):
This is similar to an ORM (Object Relational Mapper) in that it maps database nodes to Java objects.
This library is agnostic of any framework (including Spring).

* *Spring Data Neo4j* provides syntactic sugar and code on top of Neo4-OGM to help quickly build Spring based Neo4j apps.

Those coming from other Spring Data projects or are familiar with ORM products like JPA or Hibernate may quickly recognise this architecture.
A bulk of the heavy lifting takes place in Neo4j-OGM.

[NOTE]
If you come from Spring Data Neo4j 3 and want to upgrade, please consider reading the <<migration,Migration Guide>> to avoid any unwanted surprises.

== How to use this reference


Spring Data Neo4j is largely broken up into two main components:

- <<reference.ogm-support, Neo4j-OGM Support>>: Provides close integration between Spring Data and Neo4j-OGM, the main underlying technology used in SDN.
- <<neo4j.repositories, Spring Data Repository Support>>: Provides Spring Repository support.

It is recommended SDN developers also familiarise themselves with Neo4j-OGM. The Neo4j-OGM reference documentation has been reproduced after this
section for convenience.
