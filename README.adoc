= Spring Data Neo4j

The primary goal of the https://projects.spring.io/spring-data[Spring Data] project is to make it easier to build Spring-powered applications that use new data access technologies such as non-relational databases, map-reduce frameworks, and cloud based data services.

The Spring Data Neo4j project aims to provide a familiar and consistent Spring-based programming model for integrating with the https://neo4j.com/[Neo4j] Graph Database.

== Code of Conduct

This project is governed by the link:CODE_OF_CONDUCT.adoc[Spring Code of Conduct]. By participating, you are expected to uphold this code of conduct. Please report unacceptable behavior to spring-code-of-conduct@pivotal.io.

== Getting Started

Here is a quick teaser of an application using Spring Data Repositories in Java:

[source,java]
----
@NodeEntity
public class Person {
    private Long id;
    private String name;

    @Relationship(type = "FRIEND", direction = "OUTGOING")
    private Set<Person> friends;

    public Person() {}
    public Person(String name) { this.name = name; }

    private void knows(Person friend) { friends.add(friend); }
}

@Repository
public interface PersonRepository extends Neo4jRepository<Person, Long> {

  List<Person> findByName(String name);

  List<Person> findByNameLike(String name);
}

@Service
public class MyService {

    @Autowired
    private final PersonRepository repository;

    @Transactional
    public void doWork() {

        Person jon = new Person("Jon");
        Person emil = new Person("Emil");
        Person rod = new Person("Rod");

        emil.knows(jon);
        emil.knows(rod);

        // Persist entities and relationships to graph database
        personRepository.save(emil);

        for (Person friend : emil.getFriends()) {
            System.out.println("Friend: " + friend);
        }

        // Control loading depth
        Person thatSamejon = personRepository.findOne(id, 2);
        for (Person friend : jon.getFriends()) {
            System.out.println("Jon's friends to depth 2: " + friend);
        }
    }
}

@Configuration
@ComponentScan
@EnableNeo4jRepositories
@EnableTransactionManagement
public class MyConfiguration {

    @Bean
    public SessionFactory sessionFactory(org.neo4j.ogm.config.Configuration configuration) {
        // with domain entity base package(s)
        return new SessionFactory(configuration, "com.example.person.domain");
    }

    @Bean
    public org.neo4j.ogm.config.Configuration configuration() {
        org.neo4j.ogm.config.Configuration configuration = new org.neo4j.ogm.config.Configuration.Builder()
                .uri("bolt://localhost")
                .credentials("user", "secret")
                .build();
        return configuration;
    }

	@Bean
	public Neo4jTransactionManager transactionManager() {
		return new Neo4jTransactionManager(sessionFactory());
	}
}
----

=== Maven configuration

Add the Maven dependency:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframework.data</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-data-mongodb</artifactId>
  <version>${version}.RELEASE</version>
</dependency>
----

If you'd rather like the latest snapshots of the upcoming major version, use our Maven snapshot repository and declare the appropriate dependency version.

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframework.data</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-data-neo4j</artifactId>
  <version>${version}.BUILD-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>

<repository>
  <id>spring-libs-snapshot</id>
  <name>Spring Snapshot Repository</name>
  <url>https://repo.spring.io/libs-snapshot</url>
</repository>
----

Please find the setup for Gradle based projects in the the https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/data-neo4j/docs/current/reference/html/[Reference Manual].

Spring Data Neo4j provides support for connecting to all of Neo4j's java drivers:

* Bolt
* HTTP
* Embedded

Depending on your need, you'll have to add one additional Neo4j-OGM module.
Please refer to the reference linked above.

== Getting Help

Having trouble with Spring Data? We’d love to help!

* Check the
https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/neo4j/docs/current/reference/html/[reference documentation], and https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/neo4j/docs/current/api/[Javadocs].
* Learn the Spring basics – Spring Data builds on Spring Framework, check the https://spring.io[spring.io] web-site for a wealth of reference documentation.
If you are just starting out with Spring, try one of the https://spring.io/guides[guides].
* If you are upgrading, check out the https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/neo4j/docs/current/changelog.txt[changelog] for "`new and noteworthy`" features.
* Ask a question - we monitor https://stackoverflow.com[stackoverflow.com] for questions tagged with https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/spring-data-neo4j-5[spring-data-neo4j-5].
* Report bugs with Spring Data Neo4j at https://jira.spring.io/browse/DATAGRAPH[jira.spring.io/browse/DATAGRAPH].

== Reporting Issues

Spring Data uses JIRA as issue tracking system to record bugs and feature requests. If you want to raise an issue, please follow the recommendations below:

* Before you log a bug, please search the
https://jira.spring.io/browse/DATAGRAPH[issue tracker] to see if someone has already reported the problem.
* If the issue doesn’t already exist, https://jira.spring.io/browse/DATAGRAPH[create a new issue].
* Please provide as much information as possible with the issue report, we like to know the version of Spring Data that you are using and JVM version.
* If you need to paste code, or include a stack trace use JIRA `{code}…{code}` escapes before and after your text.
* If possible try to create a test-case or project that replicates the issue. Attach a link to your code or a compressed file containing your code.

== Building from Source

You don’t need to build from source to use Spring Data (binaries in https://repo.spring.io[repo.spring.io]), but if you want to try out the latest and greatest, Spring Data can be easily built with the https://github.com/takari/maven-wrapper[maven wrapper].
You also need JDK 1.8.

[source,bash]
----
 $ ./mvnw clean install
----

If you want to build with the regular `mvn` command, you will need https://maven.apache.org/run-maven/index.html[Maven v3.5.0 or above].

_Also see link:CONTRIBUTING.adoc[CONTRIBUTING.adoc] if you wish to submit pull requests, and in particular please sign the https://cla.pivotal.io/sign/spring[Contributor's Agreement] before your first non-trivial change._

=== Building reference documentation

Building the documentation builds also the project without running tests.

[source,bash]
----
 $ ./mvnw clean install -Pdistribute
----

The generated documentation is available from `target/site/reference/html/index.html`.

== Guides

The https://spring.io/[spring.io] site contains several guides that show how to use Spring Data step-by-step:

* https://spring.io/guides/gs/accessing-data-neo4j/[Accessing Data with Neo4j] is a very basic guide that shows you how to create a simple application and how to access data using repositories.
* https://spring.io/guides/gs/accessing-neo4j-data-rest/[Accessing Neo4j Data with REST] is a guide to creating a REST web service exposing data stored in Neo4j through repositories.

== Examples

* https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-data-examples/[Spring Data Examples] contains example projects that explain specific features in more detail.
