== ADR 6: Refactor definition of relationship with properties

=== Status

accepted

=== Context

The current implementation of relationship with properties has two major flaws:

. No possibility to create derived finders reaching into the target entity.
. Impossible to create two relationships of the same type connecting the same target node.

=== Decision

Signalise e.g. with an additional or modified annotation that the `@Relationship` defined on an entity points to a relationship with properties.
Within this relationship with properties representing class there should be at least a property exist that describes the target entity of the relationship.

=== Consequences

Users will have to refactor the existing `@RelationshipProperties` based relationships.
